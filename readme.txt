To install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `get-itunes-info.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place [itunesprice] in your posts, pages or widgets
4. You can include two attributes, id is required, full is optional 
	id 	= the iTunes id of the item whose info you want
	full	= yes or no. yes will return "Current Price: $" before the price, no won't. Defaults to yes.
